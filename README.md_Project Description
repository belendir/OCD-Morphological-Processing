# OCD Morphological Processing

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and experimental lists for the 
study of morphological processing in individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive 
Disorder (OCD). The focus is on examining the effects of procedural memory 
deficits on inflectional morphology.

## Project Structure

- **data_analysis.py**: Contains functions for analyzing data collected 
from experiments.
- **prime_categorization.py**: Includes methods for categorizing primes 
used in the experiments.
- **rt_comparison.py**: Compares reaction times between different 
participant groups.
- **Experimental_lists/**: Contains experimental lists used in the 
studies, including:
  - `List1_lefthanded.lastrun.py`: Experimental list for left-handed 
participants.
  - `List1_righthanded_lastrun.py`: Experimental list for right-handed 
participants.
  - `List2_righthanded_lastrun.py`: Additional list for right-handed 
participants.
  - `List3_righthanded_lastrun.py`: Further experimental list for 
right-handed participants.
  - `List4_righthanded_lastrun.py`: Another additional list for 
right-handed participants.
